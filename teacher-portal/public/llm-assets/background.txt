Jai is an 11-year-old student who attends Pendle Hill Public School in Sydney, Australia. He is currently on the Christmas and New Year break.

Jai is on the autism spectrum. He is fully verbal but has a tendency to repeat words and has a short attention span. Lessons therefore need to be highly engaging, well structured, and paced carefully, using narrative and visual hooks to sustain focus.

Jai has a strong interest in dinosaurs, especially T-Rex, and is highly motivated by movies such as Jurassic Park (multiple versions), The Grinch, and The Original Megamind. He remembers names of characters, actors, and creators (for example, Steven Spielberg) and responds strongly to lessons that reference real people.

Jai enjoys food-related motivators such as ice cream and Indian kulfi. He also shows an unusual and strong memory for place names, including suburbs such as Pendle Hill, Blacktown, Greystanes, Wentworthville, Penrith, Sydney, and Canberra. Incorporating familiar locations helps anchor abstract concepts.

Jai’s parents are Amarsh and Sarah. His teacher is Mrs Nair. His close friends include Raymond and Viraj, and he has a positive social interest in a peer named Precious. Lessons that incorporate familiar people, real names, and personal interests are likely to maximise engagement and learning.

Learner Background & Motivation

Jai is a highly engaged learner who shows strong stamina with practice and curiosity-driven problem solving. He responds best when learning is connected to a clear story, mission, or survival-style challenge rather than abstract drills.
Interest Anchor: Jurassic World – Camp Cretaceous

Jai is especially motivated by characters and scenarios from Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous. These characters provide a powerful narrative hook for maths problems involving totals, comparisons, losses, and recovery — all of which naturally align with addition and subtraction word problems.
Familiar Characters

Darius Bowman, Brooklynn, Ben Pincus, Kenji Kon, Yasmina “Yaz” Fadoula, Sammy Gutierrez, Roxie, Dave, Dr. Henry Wu, Eli Mills, Kash, Mitch, Tiff, Bumpy, Toro, and Big Eatie are all well-known to Jai and can be used interchangeably as problem protagonists.
Common Story Settings

The following environments are familiar and meaningful contexts for Jai:
Isla Nublar and the abandoned Jurassic World park
Camp Cretaceous campsite and remote survival camps
Jungle and wilderness zones, rivers, waterfalls, and nesting grounds
Main Street, ruined hotels, destroyed rides, and empty visitor areas
Gyrosphere valley, raptor paddock outskirts, and dinosaur enclosures
Maintenance tunnels, underground bunkers, labs, control rooms, helipads, and docks
Mantah Corp island and Mantah Corp dinosaur facilities
Instructional Rationale

Embedding word problems in Camp Cretaceous scenarios allows Jai to:
Visualise quantities as real objects (dinosaurs, supplies, people, vehicles).
Interpret problem structure through story logic (lost vs remaining, total supplies, differences between groups).
Stay engaged during multi-step problems by treating them as survival decisions rather than calculations.
This narrative approach supports deeper comprehension and reduces careless errors by anchoring maths to meaning.
